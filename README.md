# Welcome to UE 5 ParkourPlayground - an exploratory project where I try to implement systems from video games which i found interesting.
## Currently implemented:
### 1. Parkour-ish vault system, allowing to traverse smaller obstacles and climb on walls. 
### 2. Target selecting/locking system, highlighting object closest to camera's look at angle, with possibility to lock on currently focused target
### 3. Weapon-focused combat system, where player's attack style is dictated by the currently wielded weapon.

## In progress:
### Parkour system expansion (wall run, climbing ledges)
### Enemy AI + BossFight
### Block ability and ranged attacks
